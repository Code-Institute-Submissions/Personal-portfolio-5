Another feature idea

Technologies Used
In this website i have only used HTML5 and CSS 3. 

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

I really had alot of problem with mobile and ipad first use section it was really different from 
other part my work i an say i have used youtube, google and CSS school website in order to find 
many thing and setup it again and again. 

i am not going to pest any codes here but i can say that it made my crazy but i am happy to fnish the project.


Deployment
As part of project requirment i have created mokap and start coding on Githup/gitpod i have start
with HTML and CSS coding on computer screen base and then put media section for ipad and mobile first use.


In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
