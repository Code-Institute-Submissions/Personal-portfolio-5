## Testing
While is start testing my project i learned many new thing like... 1. the mobiel part desing was one of my bigest challange in this project in media coding i have learned how much is important to have write names , class or IDs for each part that could be remember easly and understand the codeing. 2. when i did the checklist i recognized that i have missed some part of my project and some i have use not good colors i start understing the developer roll and customer need and way of lookig to the project. 
3. i have stat testing my website on validator there i get some few error and it was my frist time i have ever testing such project so i got to learn more of project and different prat of debuging. 
4. commmiting was also a challange for me up 2-Sept-2020 i didn't knew that i have committed when i am changing small part of my code or anything that may cause problem in future and is very important for other developers to know about that part with correct detials for information so after mentioned date and my last meeting with my mentor i have learned how to commit and what i have write in commit to be understandable. 


## Deployment
As part of project requirment i have created mokap and start coding on Githup/gitpod i have start
with HTML and CSS coding on computer screen base and then put media section for ipad and mobile first use..... to write more detials
