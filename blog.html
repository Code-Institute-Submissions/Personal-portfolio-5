                <h1> It is cold in December in Kabul</h1>
                    <p> We have received recent reports from our Shuhada Organization 
                            trainers from seven discussion groups working within the 
                            framework of Gender Listening Action Groups in Kabul, The trainers meet people who seek advice regarding problems that are sometimes difficult to solve during a couple of conversations. But they can - for the most part - find the way to a solution, especially when working with friends and acquaintances. On the other hand, when they are involved in a situation that affects entire families, they are seen as outsiders. Then they can not always get involved in family matters. Or when it comes to such sensitive issues as child marriage. Most problems arise when individuals - or married couples - oppose the family patterns that are deeply rooted in the traditional, conservative culture. The pressure comes from both - often the elderly - family members and from the environment.
                    A special attitude is required towards people with drug problems and their relatives.
                    The work continues
                    The trainers have created several "individual groups" when the members meet in pairs. From the beginning, our idea was to have slightly larger groups, but it has proved difficult to create sufficient security in them.
                    The educators also use chat to broaden opportunities for contact within the group.
                    We are proud of the work that these brave students do in Kabul in our project. It feels hopeful, despite the cold.</p>

                <h1>Recovering from War in Kabul</h1>
                    <p>Day 5 of our workshop, and the participants are sharing their stories related to war. 
                        The purpose is both to practice to deal with their own experiences and to 
                        train their ability to help others by listening to others processing their war memories. We talked about how war is the ultimate expression of human irrationality. War pushes all inequalities and oppression in a society to its extremes. Women are raped as a means of war. Children are neglected and abused, and witness things they cannot process. Men are expected to kill and get killed.
                        The exercises First exercise for the participants was to tell each other about their personal stories related to war. That is an important part of healing emotionally from war and to start rebuilding trust in others. It’s also crucial for getting the experiences processed so that the individual is less likely to be pulled into destructive behaviour towards herself or himself, or others.
                        We were a bit cautious about this exercise since we know it can feel really tough to revisit bad memories, and we actually planned not to do this exercise – until an interpreter saw the question and spontaneously said that “This is an important question for us!”
                        It turned out really well. We heard everything from young adults thinking they didn’t have any experience of war.</p>

                <h1>Namibia. The work continues</h1>
                    <p>Our project for women's and children's rights in rural Namibia, in Kamanjab in the Kunene region, continues. During discussions in our study circles, it has been concluded that support is important for securing women's and children's rights. Therefore, Pots of Hope has started a garden project with cultivation and sales to local stores.
                        We have both discussion groups for adults and for children. And for leaders, of course. A police officer and a female representative from the Ministry of Gender came to visit one day, and the meeting felt important and productive.
                        2019 Evaluation and planning for the coming years is complete. It has been a bit difficult to involve young people in the project, so Pots of Hope is investigating the possibility of also starting with computer training. Study circles should be slightly shorter than before. Searching for new volunteers among the local population gives results, 
                        but we have to work a little harder because more men and women engage in dialogue with each other..</p>
